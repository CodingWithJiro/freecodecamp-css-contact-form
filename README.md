![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project demonstrates a clean and responsive contact form built using HTML5 and modern CSS. It includes built-in HTML validation and visual feedback for input states, ensuring both functionality and user-friendliness.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## üîç Overview

This project consists of a contact form with three key input fields: name, email, and message. The form uses semantic HTML for accessibility and is styled using custom CSS variables for maintainability and visual appeal.

The design includes hover, focus, valid, and invalid visual states for inputs and a responsive layout that works across different screen sizes. The form submits data to [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/post) for testing form handling.
